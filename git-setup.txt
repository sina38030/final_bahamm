STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO UPLOAD YOUR PROJECT TO GITHUB
=================================================

BEFORE YOU START:
1. Make sure you have a GitHub account (sign up at github.com)
2. Install Git on your computer (download from git-scm.com)

STEP 1: INITIALIZE GIT IN YOUR PROJECT
--------------------------------------
Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - E-commerce platform with Next.js and FastAPI"

STEP 2: CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY ON GITHUB
-----------------------------------------
1. Go to github.com and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository name: "ecommerce-platform" (or any name you prefer)
5. Description: "Full-stack e-commerce platform with Persian support"
6. Keep it Public (or Private if you prefer)
7. DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
8. Click "Create repository"

STEP 3: CONNECT YOUR LOCAL PROJECT TO GITHUB
--------------------------------------------
GitHub will show you the commands. Use the "push an existing repository" section:

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

Replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

STEP 4: VERIFY UPLOAD
--------------------
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all your files uploaded
3. The README.md file will be displayed automatically

EXAMPLE COMMANDS (replace with your details):
--------------------------------------------
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/ecommerce-platform.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

FUTURE UPDATES:
--------------
After making changes to your code, you can update GitHub with:

git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push

IMPORTANT NOTES:
---------------
- The .gitignore file will exclude sensitive files (database, logs, etc.)
- Make sure not to commit any API keys or sensitive information
- The project is ready to be shared publicly
- Other developers can clone and run your project using the README instructions

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
If you get authentication errors:
1. Use GitHub Desktop app (easier for beginners)
2. Or set up SSH keys (more advanced)
3. Or use personal access tokens instead of password
