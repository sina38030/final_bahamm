## My current analysis:

The error message `1684-91dcf3bc30813fb1.js` means you're loading **minified/production code**.

But `npm run dev` serves **development code** (unminified).

**This means:**
- You're accessing the wrong port
- OR there's a service worker caching old files
- OR you have a production build somewhere

## Do this test:

Open browser console and type:
```javascript
console.log(window.location.href)
```

What does it print?
